Wow, you're actually reading this? That's amazing. 
This will hopefully become my framework for any Ogre3d related projects.

I'm not expert on source code licenses, but read the one below for information.
Uses the zlib license. It basically
says you can use this for anything you'd like as long as it doesn't contain
adult or illegal themes, you must not claim this software as your own, you
must clearly mark all of your changes within the code should you redistribute
it, and this license must not be removed from files where it already is. Oh,
and you don't have to acknowledge that it's my work, but that would be
greatly appreciated.

If you find any errors at all in my code or know of a better way to accomplish
a task, please let me know! I'm a bit more experienced than a beginner, but
I've still got a lot to learn, and if you think you can show me up, please do,
I'd love to know a better way of doing it!

If you need me for anything involving this, please do not email me (the one
I commit with is not checked often). Instead, message me on the Ogre3d forums.
